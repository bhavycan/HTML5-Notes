    <title>Table and Lists</title>
</head>
<body>

    <!-- The lists are basically of two types-
    1) Ordered lists
    2) Unorderd List -->

    <!-- The difference between an ordered and an unordered list is that the ordered list displays the list in this format -

1.

2.

3.

….

On the other hand, the unordered lists display the list in the following format-

.
.
.
…. -->
   <ul>
       <li>This is the first item in my unorderd list</li>
       <li>This is the second item in my unorderd list</li>
       <li>This is the third item in my unorderd list</li>
   </ul> 
   <ol>
       <li>This is my first orderd list</li>
       <li>This is my second orderd list</li>
       <li>This is my third orderd list</li>
   </ol>



   <!-- Both the lists have more than one attribute which we can write using the type command. For example, if we write: -->
   <ol type="I">
   <!-- Then we will get the lists as I, II, III, and so on. In the same format, we can also get the lists as A, B, C, and so on.   -->
    <li>This is my first orderd list</li>
    <li>This is my second orderd list</li>
    <li>This is my third orderd list</li>
   </ol>

   <!-- This applies on unordered lists also. If we write -->
   <ul type="square">
    <li>This is the first item in my unorderd list</li>
    <li>This is the second item in my unorderd list</li>
    <li>This is the third item in my unorderd list</li>
   </ul>
   <!-- Then we will get a bulleted square instead of a circle. There are various other references available from which you can see all the attributes. There is no need to learn all these things. You will get perfect by practising. -->

   <!-- HTML also allows the nesting of lists. It simply means we can add a list into another list -->
   <ul type="circle">
    <li>This is the first item in my unorderd list</li>
    <li>This is the second item in my unorderd list</li>
    <ul>
        <li>another one</li>
        <li>second one</li>
        <li> third one</li>
    </ul>
    <li>This is the third item in my unorderd list</li>
   </ul>






   <!-- The main part is the table tag, and it consists of two parts: the table head and table body. The <thead> consists of the main head of the table and <tbody> consists of the body of the table. 

    <tr> is used to justify that it is the part of a row. Inside the <tr> tag, we give the headings of a row under the <th> tag. The final structure of a table looks like- -->
            <!-- Structure:
            <table>

                        </th>
                    </tr>
