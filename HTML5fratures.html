   <!-- The <!DOCTYPE> is a declaration tag that represents the document type.
   The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the web browser
   about what version of HTML the page is written in.
Although this declaration is not required, it should be the first line of the HTML code
if the developer decides to include it. -->

     <!-- The <html> tag is the root element of this tree.
           It contains all of the other HTML elements, except the <!doctype> tag.  
        This example, contains two elements: <head> and <body>. -->

<head>
   <!-- The <head> tag contains a <title> tag, which contains the text “Sample page”
in the example.
The <head> element can contain the following tags:
title ( <title>),
scripts (<script>),
style (<style>),
style sheet links ( <link>),
meta information (<meta>),
browser support information and other initialization functions (<base>).-->

HTML user agents, commonly known as browsers, parse the markup, turning it into a DOM (Document
Object Model) tree.
A DOM tree is an in-memory representation of a document.
DOM trees contain several kinds of nodes, which include a DOCTYPE node, elements such
as headers and paragraphs, text nodes, and comment nodes.   -->
